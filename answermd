Understanding Project Management in Node.js

a. Package Managers

What is a package manager?
A package manager is a tool that helps developers install, update, and manage external libraries or modules in a project.
Example: Instead of manually downloading a library, you can run a single command like npm install express.

Why do we need package managers in backend development?
They save time by automating installation of dependencies.
They ensure consistency across different environments such as development, testing, and production.
They allow easy sharing of projects with others by listing required packages.

Problems faced if package managers are not used
Developers would need to manually download and configure libraries.
It becomes difficult to track versions of dependencies.
Sharing projects becomes complicated because teammates won’t know which libraries are required.

b. NPM (Node Package Manager)

What is NPM?
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js.
It comes bundled when you install Node.js.

Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?
It provides access to thousands of open-source libraries.
It makes dependency management simple and reliable.
It helps in project initialization and publishing packages.

How NPM helps in managing dependencies
It stores all required packages in a node_modules folder.
It keeps track of versions in package.json and package-lock.json.
It allows easy installation (npm install) and removal (npm uninstall) of packages.

c. Backend Project Initialization

Command used to initialize a backend project
npm init

What npm init does
It starts a step-by-step setup process asking details like project name, version, description, entry file, etc.
It creates a package.json file with the provided information.

What npm init -y does
It skips the questions and creates a package.json file with default values.
It is useful for quickly starting a project.

d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization

package.json
Contains metadata about the project such as name, version, description.
Lists dependencies and scripts.
Acts as the blueprint of the project.

node_modules
Folder where all installed packages are stored.
Automatically created when you install dependencies.
Can become very large because it contains all libraries and their sub-dependencies.

package-lock.json
Records the exact versions of installed packages.
Ensures consistency when the project is installed on another machine.
Prevents version conflicts.

Which files or folders should not be pushed to GitHub and why
node_modules should not be pushed because it is very large in size and can be recreated using npm install from package.json. Pushing it wastes storage and slows down cloning.

Which files must be committed and why
package.json must be committed because it defines project dependencies and scripts and is essential for others to run the project.
package-lock.json must be committed because it ensures exact versions of dependencies are installed and prevents bugs caused by version mismatches.

Summary
Package managers like NPM make backend development easier by handling dependencies and project setup. With npm init, developers can quickly start projects, and files like package.json and package-lock.json ensure consistency across environments. Avoid pushing node_modules to GitHub, but always commit package.json and package-lock.json.
